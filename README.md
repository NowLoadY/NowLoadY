### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is NowLoadY, and I'm so glad to notice that you are interested in my stories!
I am a college student, and I'm so interested in Robotics! That's the reason why I came here. The environment in here is good, everyone is full of kindness and patience, and it's not hard to see: everyone in GitHub all has a fighting-heart.  
  
I like watching Japan's anime, and I like drawing too! Then, games are indispensable! Recently, I'm playing with WatchDogs2, it's a great work finished by Ubisoft:
