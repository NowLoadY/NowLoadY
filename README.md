Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a college student majoring in Mechanical Design, Manufacturing and Automation, and I have been interested in programming, anime, gaming, robotics, AI image recognition, drawing, and 3D modeling for about two years. In my GitHub, you can find my projects and contributions, which are the result of my studies and practice. I'm eager to learn new technologies and apply them to my studies and projects.

In the past two years, I have been dedicated to mastering various skills through continuous learning and practice. I'm happy to communicate with other developers and learn from them. I believe that by continuously learning and practicing, I will be able to improve my skills and abilities and make valuable contributions to the community.

If you have any questions or suggestions about my projects or contributions, please feel free to contact me. I'm always willing to share my experience and insights with you. Thank you for visiting my profile, and I look forward to connecting with you!
