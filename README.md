### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
&ensp;&ensp;My name is NowLoadY, and I'm so glad to notice that you are interested in my stories!
I am a college student who is studying "mechanical design and manufacturing and its automation", and I'm so interested in Robotics! That's the reason why I came here. The environment in here is good, everyone is full of kindness and patience, and it's not hard to see: everyone in GitHub all has a fighting-heart.  
&ensp;&ensp;I like watching Japan's anime, and I like drawing too! Then, games are indispensable! Recently, I'm playing with WatchDogs2, it's a great work finished by Ubisoft.  
  
&ensp;&ensp;Iâ€™m currently working on a RC-car, in my imagination, it should have some amazing way to be controlled, I can't stop thinking how it would be if I use my Samsung Galaxy Watch to control it! And its control program is going to be wrote in dart, which is the main language of flutter. I'm also writing RC-car's program, which includes "dealing with sensors signal", "controling motor in a correct speed" and so onðŸ˜„
